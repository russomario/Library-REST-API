# Library REST API

This project has the goal to become  more familiar with the Go language. <br>
It has two major components: the **Database** and the **REST API** interface. The database is a relational one (MySQL). It stores the books added via the APIs. The APIs act as an interface between the client and the database and take care of data validation as well as adding, deleting and retrieving them.

### General operating scheme

### Requirements

- Go
- MySQL

### MySQL Setup
1. Create a database
```sql
CREATE DATABASE library;
````
To make sure the database has been created you can execute this command:
```sql
SHOW DATABASE;
```
The output should be similar to this and should contain **library**:
```
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| library            |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| recordings         |
| sys                |
+--------------------+
```
Once the database is created select it using the following command:
```sql
USE library;
```
2. Create a table
```sql
CREATE TABLE book(
    isbn VARCHAR(17) PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL,
    author VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
    summary TEXT NOT NULL,
    pub_year INT NOT NULL
)
```
To make sure that you created the table you can execute this command:
```sql
DESCRIBE book;
```
The output should be the following:
```
+----------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field    | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+----------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| isbn     | varchar(17)  | NO   | PRI | NULL    |       |
| title    | varchar(256) | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
| author   | varchar(128) | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
| summary  | text         | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
| pub_year | int          | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+----------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
```

3. Populate the table (optional):
If you want to have same record you can execute the following command in you sql shell:
```sql
INSERT INTO book values (
    "978-0-452-26756-5",
    "Mastery: The Keys to Success and Long-Term Fulfillment",
    "George Leonard",
    "Whether you're seeking to improve your career or your intimate relationships, increase self-esteem or create harmony within yourself, this inspiring prescriptive guide will help you master anything you choose and achieve success in all areas of your life.",
    1992);
```

```sql
INSERT INTO book values (
    "978-88-541-8089-5",
    "Le avventure di Sherlock Holmes",
    "Conan Doyle",
    "Il pi첫 popolare detective di tutta la letteratua mondiale.",
    1991);
```

### Go enviroment
The source files for Go are placed in the **src** folder. It's composed by two modules:
1. databse_manager
2. handler_api

Before running the application you need to setup some environment variables:
1. DBUSER
2. DBPASS

In Unix/MacOS you can do that by:
```bash
export DBUSER=user
export DBPASS=password
```

To start the server you have to run in the root folder
```bash
go run .
```

Make sure to download all the dependencies with
```bash
go get .
```
